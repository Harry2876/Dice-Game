      <h1>ðŸª„Rules for the Game</h1>
      <p>
        <span>Objective:</span> The objective of the game is to be the first
        player to reach a predefined total score, typically 100 points.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Players:</span> The game is played between two players taking
        turns.
      </p>
      <p><span>Game Setup:</span> Each player starts with a score of 0.</p>
      <h1 style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 10px">Gameplay:</h1>
      <p>
        Players take turns to roll a six-sided dice, The number rolled on the
        dice is added to the player's current score.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player can roll the dice multiple times in a turn to accumulate
        points, but if they roll a 1, they lose all the points gained in that
        turn,and it becomes the next player's turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player has the option to "hold," which means they choose to end
        their turn and add their current score to their main score. It then
        becomes the next player's turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first player to reach or exceed the predefined total score wins the
        game.<br />
        Alternatively, the game can continue until one player reaches the target
        score.
      </p>
      <p>
        By following these rules, players can enjoy a strategic and exciting
        game of dice rolling, balancing risk and reward to achieve
        victory.ðŸª„âœ¨ðŸ’•
